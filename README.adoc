= SYCL 2023 Embedded Zig Workshop

== Prerequisites

- https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git]
- https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm[Arm GNU Toolchain (for GDB)]
- Some sort of programming environment

You can use whatever IDE you like, I personally use neovim and the terminal. If you are unfamiliar with setting up your own programming environment, https://code.visualstudio.com/download[install VSCode].

== Installing Zig

Your laptop will fit under one of these platform strings:

- x86_64-linux
- x86_64-macos
- x86_64-windows
- aarch64-linux
- aarch64-macos

Open a command prompt/terminal run the command `./tools/zigup/<platform>/zigup master`, on windows it will be `zigup.exe`. This will install the zig compiler on your machine.
