== Prerequisites

* https://git-scm.com/downloads[Git]
* https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/gnu-rm[Arm GNU Toolchain (for GDB)]
** NOTE: for the windows installer, select the "add to path" option
* Some sort of programming environment. If you are unsure, https://code.visualstudio.com/download[install VSCode]

=== Installing Zig

Your laptop will fit under one of these platform strings:

- x86_64-linux
- x86_64-macos
- x86_64-windows
- aarch64-linux
- aarch64-macos

Open a command prompt/terminal run the command `./tools/zigup/<platform>/zigup master`, on windows it will be `zigup.exe`. This will install the zig compiler on your machine.

If this does not work for you for some reason, you can download zig from https://ziglang.org/download/[here]. We are using the master build for this workshop.
